# Classifying-mnist-dataset-using-MLP
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images taken from American Census Bureau employees and American high school students. 
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN).An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer,
a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised
learning technique called backpropagation for training.Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can 
distinguish data that is not linearly separable.This project is an implementation of MLP to classify mnist data.
